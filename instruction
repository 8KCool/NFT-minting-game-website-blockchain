it takes sometime for sync process , no its really quick
I win , sync process depends on how much data needed to be sync + how much complication of the process ,
website like ours , it is very complicated to update changes with all of these summitions 
That's why I predicted slowness in sync ,...

is everything clear?

No :D 
Whenever I need changes , I will contact you ;)
okay sure no problem :)
