                    He was at the center of the Event, the very catalyst that set off everything. The great start at the center of the
                    Marsten Galaxy held within its power so great that no one, not a single person or creature in the universe, was said
                    to be able to stand it. He did not believe them, and he did not heed the warnings laid before him. He created a lab,
                    big as anything, and a great and powerful drill, with which he planned to break through to the heart of the great
                    star. He was going to harness the power of it to help people, all across the galaxy.

                    greater than he could ever have imagined. Eleven beams, some brighter than others and some even brighter than
                    that, bounced out into the Marsten Galaxy and hit eleven unsuspecting people, granting them the very powers he
                    had been searching for. He, at the center of it, got them too, impenetrable, unkillable power. The beams shot
                    through him first, one after the other, eleven shots directly to the chest. There was a price, though, for though those
                    eleven people lived, every single other person in the entire galaxy was killed by the blast. Now, Dr M.G. gathers the
                    eleven to him, trying to fix his mistake by giving them better lives than they had before.

                    machines constantly, and factory accidents were very common. He went to work every day with the knowledge that, at
                    any moment, something could happen that would kill him. At the moment of the event, he was in the middle of repairs
                    on an industrial welder, and the force of the blast (and the subsequent beam that hit him square in the chest) knocked
                    him back, pushing against the welder and searing off half of his face and giving him third degree burns everywhere.

the constant moving, and because his parents could not afford to buy new ones, when they began to break down they
packed up their caravan, moved everything onto a spaceship, and moved to the space colony of 03-33-29, where the
superior technology was able to create him properly, bionic legs to replace the prosthetics. He lived a happy and cheerful
life among the inhabitants of 03-33-29, until the moment of the Event when he suddenly found himself sitting in an

instead the bionics were welded to him, to his brain stem so that he may control them as anyone else would. It was hard
for him to adjust to living with the doctor and the others, he missed his community back home as all of them did, but
he settled in nevertheless.

Lintaqreg. Apparently, when explorers from other areas in the Marsten Galaxy happened upon them, they had
misunderstood the word “janes” (the Lizard people&apos;s word for &apos;welcome&apos;) as being the name of the planet, and
no amount of correcting had seemed to do history any good.

Flake found himself sobbing alone in a swamp, the power that surged through him had strengthened his heart
and given him the strength to carry on. Peaceful warriors are still warriors, and Flake was still an excellent
fighter. His addition to the team was a welcome one, and he was happy to, once again, find himself among
people who considered him a friend.

Billy had traveled through as a child. She was trained in the army, and was carted from troop to troop as each one

of it) for weeks, until she ran out of groceries and went into town to get more, but it also took just as long for the
scientist to track her down and summon her to him. She hadn&apos;t even noticed the new power she possessed now, had
broken a few doors and just assumed that they had been rotting without her noticing it. She didn&apos;t work well with the

also happened at the same time as another, significantly smaller explosion in the galaxy records office that destroyed any
evidence of that colony ever having existed. This explosion had also severely damaged and scarred his face, so Regen
had gotten used to covering it with a large mask. Unfortunately, because the injuries had healed years before the Event
the power was unable to fix them, but only provide a more interesting face covering to make him more comfortable.

                    Ultron lived in a different sector of the planet known to most people as Planet Janus, and known to the Lizard people of the planet
itself as Planet Lintaqreg. This sector wasn&apos;t too far away from Flake&apos;s sector of Perrigard, and was known as Kiilon. Flake might
have even run into Ultron, had he chosen to venture outside of his own small encampment. Either way, he didn&apos;t, and so they did
not meet until after the summoning. Unlike Flake, Ultron was a fierce and savage warrior. He never got to practice these skills on
anything except prey, though, because the Lizard people continued to be an annoyingly peaceful species and so there were never
any wars for him to fight in.

                    After the Event, Ultron traveled silently around the planet, taking in the sights and pilfering random encampments whenever he
came across them, pretending like he was plundering conquered villages. This was the closest he would ever get to living out his
dream as a mighty warrior, or so he thought, until the scientist&apos;s summons reached him and he finally, for the first time found
himself in a place where his skills were needed and even appreciated for what they could do.

                    Vader grew up in the poor sector of the planet Korkoron, working as a blacksmith for most of his life. He became incredibly
skilled, but the work did not interest him. What did interest him, though, was hunting and fighting, which was why he ended
up quitting his job as a tradesman and joining the army instead. There, because the planet Korkoron was in the middle of a
giant war, he found himself right in his element, fighting with other great warriors just like him. It was exactly the sort of
thing he had always dreamed about, and he was incredibly excited about all the new opportunities it had given him.

                    Then, at the moment of the Event, he found himself standing next to a large tankard full of explosives. They were the sort of
explosive that could be activated with the press of a button, and unfortunately for him, the force of the Event pushed him
directly into the button, exploding the tankard and both of his legs right along with it. The energy that surged through him
right then was amazing, and it was able to grow most of his legs back, except right past the knee.
Perhaps something went wrong, or he pleaded with it not to, but instead of flesh, below the knee, his legs were made bionic,
and when he could stand again, he found he could jump great distances and run faster than he ever had before.

                    Alita was born on the desert planet Innon. She was never trained in her skills. It was like she was born with them, an incredibly
strong fighter from the moment she learned to walk. Her skill only grew as she got older, and so though maybe some of the
others, some of the ones who had never been made for fighting but now were forced to due to circumstance, had only been hit by
the beams by chance, and perhaps were not deserving of their power… Alita was the exact right person to be hit, and the power
she felt after the Event did not scare her. When the doctor summoned her, it was less of a terrifying call to action, and more of a
sort of homecoming.

event has taken place. He heard everyone&apos;s stories. In the end, Dr.M.G. offered all of them to create a team or league. Since each
one of them has got a chance to be a hero with special talents. They took some time to think but it did not last that long, since
they already knew that they don&apos;t have anything to lose, not anymore.
Dr.M.G. suggested to start their first fight in Dex sector, or what they have called it, Dex Battle. Overall, no one knows how
Dr.M.G. got the leadership of this team easily. As his powers are still unknown until now. All of them thought that he just got
some mind tricks and mind power. But they missed that Dr.M.G. was at the same place of the event and the 11 beams have hit him
before they got distributed to them. He gathered them in order to start to tell them about the most important and confidential
project ever. The Mutated weapon projects
